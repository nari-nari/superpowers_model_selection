# Handling a Report That Isn't DONE

Part of superpowers:subagent-driven-development.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, focus/add needed information or validly split; compare supported context settings before re-dispatch
2. If reasoning/domain competence is insufficient, use model-selection to qualify configurations for that deficit and account for handoff costs
3. If tools/authentication fail, fix the environment rather than treating price/capability as the cure
4. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
5. If the plan itself is wrong, rule on the correction, ledger it, and re-dispatch with the ruling carried in the dispatch

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.
